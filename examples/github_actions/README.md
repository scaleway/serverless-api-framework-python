# Deploy your serverless project using Github Actions

With this example, you will be able to deploy your serverless project using our framework with Github Actions.  
To do so, simply copy the "deploy.yml" file in ".github/workflows".

It will automatically run `srvless deploy` in the project route to deploy your project on Scaleway's Serverless Functions on each Tag.
