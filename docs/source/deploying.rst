Deploying
=========

After writing your functions, the included CLI tool `scw-serverless` helps deploy your application on Scaleway.

Deploy
------

The `deploy` command will deploy your functions directly.

.. code-block:: console

    scw-serverless deploy --help

The command will wait until all functions are deployed and ready to be called. It will also deploy the corresponding triggers.

Generate
--------

Generators will generate configuration files to use with other deployment tools.
Currently, you can generate either a `serverless` or `terraform` configuration file. This can be useful to integrate with your existing tooling.

Config file generation is done with the `generate` command:

.. code-block:: console

    scw-serverless generate -t serverless

Serverless Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. autoclass:: scw_serverless.config.generators.ServerlessFrameworkGenerator

Terraform Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. autoclass:: scw_serverless.config.generators.TerraformGenerator

Dependencies
------------

.. warning:: Native dependencies are not yet handled by the framework.

Currently, dependencies are handled by including a `requirements.txt` file at the root of your project.
Other dependencies management tools such as pipenv or poetry are not yet supported.

Check out the `requirements file reference`_ documentation for more information.
