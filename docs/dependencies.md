# Dependencies

```{warning} Native dependencies are not yet handled by the framework.
```

Currently, dependencies are handled by including a `requirements.txt` file at the root of your project.
Other dependencies management tools such as pipenv or poetry are not yet supported.

See: <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/> for more information on the requirements file format.
