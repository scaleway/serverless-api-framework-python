# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Scaleway we take security seriously. If you have any issue regarding security,
please notify us by sending an email to security@scaleway.com.

Please DO NOT create a GitHub issue.

We will follow up with you promptly with more information and a plan for remediation.
We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but we would love to send some
Scaleway swag your way along with our deepest gratitude for your assistance in making
Scaleway a more secure Cloud ecosystem.
